# 0035: Record session attendance

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-11-13
Source: [Issue 469](https://github.com/Nucleo-Estudantes-Informatica-ISEP/fallstack-website/issues/469)

## Context

Action completions cannot represent attendance separately for each session.
Attendance must preserve the time and scanner while preventing duplicate scans.

## Decision

Record one check-in per student and schedule session, without check-out. Accept
scans from the session start through its end, inclusive; reject scans outside
that interval without a grace period. Authorize the global NEI `nei-member`
grant and admins. Retain attendance when a scanner is deleted by clearing the
scanner reference, and restrict deletion of sessions with attendance. Deleting
a student cascades to their check-ins.

## Consequences

Staff need a fresh login to receive the new grant in their application session.
Sessions with attendance require the records to be removed before deletion. The
scanner is no longer attributable after that user is deleted. A future change
to early or break-time scans requires an explicit product decision.
